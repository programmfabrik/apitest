The apitesting tool helps you to build automated apitests that can be run after every build to ensure a constant product quality.

A single testcase is also a perfect definition of an occuring problem and helps the developers to fix your issues faster!

# Configuration file
For configuring the apitest tool, add the follwing section to your 'apitest.yml' configuration file.

The report parameters of this config can be overwritten via a command line flag. So you should set your intended standar
```yaml
apitest:
  server: "http://5.simon.pf-berlin.de/api/v1" # The base url to the api you want to fire the apitests against. Important: don’t add a trailing ‘/’
  report: # Configures the maschine report. For usage with jenkis or any other CI tool
    file: "apitest_report.xml" # Filename of the report file. The file gets saved in the same directory of the apitest binary
    format: "json.junit"       # Format of the report. (Supported formats: json or junit)
  store: # initial values for the datastore, parsed as map[string]interface{}
    email.server: smtp.google.com
  oauth2_client: # Map of client-config for oAuth clients
    my_client: # oauth Client ID
      endpoint: # endpoints on the oauth server
        auth_url: "http://auth.myserver.de/oauth/auth"
        token_url: "http://auth.myserver.de/oauth/token"
      secret: "foobar" # oauth Client secret
      redirect_url: "http://myfancyapp.de/auth/receive-fancy-token" # redirect, usually on client side
```

The YAML config is optional. All config values can be overwritten/set by command line parameters: see [Overwrite config parameters](#overwrite-config-parameters)

## Command line interface

You start the apitest tool with the following command

```bash
./apitest
```

This starts the command with the following default settings:

- Runs all tests that are in the current directory, or in any of its subdirectories
- Logs to console
- Writes the machine log, to the given file in the apitest.yml
- Logs only the request & responses if a test fails

### Configure which tests should be run

- `--directory testDirectory` or `-d testDirectory`: Defines which directory should be used for running the tests in it. The tool walks recursively trough all subdirectories and runs alls tests that have a "manifest.json" file in alphabetical order of the folder names. (Depth-First-Search)
- `--single path/to/a/single/manifest.json` or `-s path/to/a/single/manifest.json`: Run only a single test. The path needs to point directly to the manifest file. (Not the directory containing it)

### Stop on fail

- `stop-on-fail`: Stop execution of later test suites if a test suite fails

### Configure logging

Per default request and response of a request will be logged on test failure. If you want to see more information you
can configure the tool with additional log flags

- `--log-network`: Log all network traffic
- `--log-datastore`: Logs datastore operations into datastore
- `--log-verbose`: `--log-network`, `--log-datastore` and a few additional trace informations
- `--log-timestamp` / `-t`: Log the timestamp of the log message into the console
- `--curl-bash`: Log the request as curl command
- `-l`: Limit the lines of request log output. Configure limit in apitest.yml

You can also set the log verbosity per single testcase. The greater verbosity wins.


#### Console logging

- `--log-console-enable false`: If you want to see a log in the console this parameter needs to be "true" (what is also the default)
- `--log-console-level debug`: Sets the loglevel which controls what kind of output should be displayed in the console
  - `--log-console-level info` (default): Shows only critical information
  - `--log-console-level warn`: Shows more verbose log output
  - `--log-console-level debug`: Shows all possible log output

#### SQLite logging

- `--log-sqlite-enable false`: If you want to save the into a sqlite databasethis parameter needs to be "true"
- `--log-sqlite-file newLog.db`: Defines the filename in which the sqlite log should be saved
- `--log-sqlite-level debug`: Sets the loglevel which controls what kind of output should be saved into the sqlite database
  - `--log-sqlite-level info` (default): Saves only critical information
  - `--log-sqlite-level warn`: Saves more verbose log output
  - `--log-sqlite-level debug`: Saves all possible log output

### Overwrite config parameters

- `--config subfolder/newConfigFile` or `-c subfolder/newConfigFile`: Overwrites the path of the config file (default "./apitest.yml") with "subfolder/newConfigFile"
- `--server URL`: Overwrites base url to the api
- `--report-file newReportFile`: Overwrites the report file name from the apitest.yml config with "newReportFile"
- `--report-format junit`: Overwrites the report format from the apitest.yml config with "junit"
- `--replace-host [host][:port]`: Overwrites built-in server host in template function "replace_host"

### Examples

- Run all tests in the directory **apitests** display **all server communication** and safe the maschine report as **junit** for later parsing it with *jenkins*

```bash
./apitest --directory apitests --verbosity 2 --report-format junit
```

- Only run a single test **apitests/test1/manifest.json** with **no console output** and save the maschine report to the standard file defined in the apitest.yml

```bash
./apitest --single apitests/test1/manifest.json --log-console-enable false
```

- Run all tests in the directory **apitests** with **http server host replacement** for those templates using **replace_host** template function
```bash
./apitest -d apitests --replace-host my.fancy.host:8989
```


# Manifest

Manifest is loaded as **template**, so you can use variables, Go **range** and **if** and others.

```yaml
{
    // General info about the testuite. Try to explain your problem indepth here. So that someone who works on the test years from now knows what is happening
    "description": "search api tests for filename",
    // Testname. Should be the ticket number if the test is based on a ticket
    "name": "ticket_48565",
    // init store
    "store": {
        "custom": "data"
    },
    // Testsuites your want to run upfront (e.g. a setup). Paths are relative to the current test manifest
    "require": [
        "setup_manifests/purge.yaml",
        "setup_manifests/config.yaml",
        "setup_manifests/upload_datamodel.yaml"
    ],
    // Array of single testcases. Add es much as you want. They get executed in chronological order
    "tests": [
        // [SINGLE TESTCASE]: See below for more information
        // [SINGLE TESTCASE]: See below for more information
        // [SINGLE TESTCASE]: See below for more information

        // We also support the external loading of a complete test:
        "@pathToTest.json"

        // By prefixing it with a p the testtool runs the tests all in parallel. All parallel tests are then set to ContinueOnFailure !
        "p@pathToTestsThatShouldRunInParallel.json"
    ]

    ],

    "reverse_test_result": false
}
```


## Run tests in parallel

The tool is able to do run tests in parallel. You activate this mechanism by including a external testfile with `p@pathtofile.json`.
The `p@` indicates to load that external file and run all tests in it in parallel.

**All tests that are run in parallel are implicit set to ContinueOnFailure as otherwise the log and report would make no
sense**

```yaml
{
    "name": "Binary Comparison",
    "request": {
        "endpoint": "suggest",
        "method": "GET"
    },
    // Path to binary file with @
    "response": "@simple.bin"
}
```
## Binary data comparison

The tool is able to do a comparison with a binary file. Here we take a MD5 hash of the file and and then later compare
that hash.

For comparing a binary file, simply point the response to the binary file:

```yaml
{
    "name": "Binary Comparison",
    "request": {
        "endpoint": "suggest",
        "method": "GET"
    },
    // Path to binary file with @
    "response": {
        "format": {
            "type": "binary"
        },
        "body": {
            "md5sum": {{ md5sum "@simple.bin" || marshal }}
        }
    }
}
```

> The format must be specified as `"type": "binary"`

## XML Data comparison

If the response format is specified as `"type": "xml"`, we internally marshal that XML into json. (With github.com/clbanning/mxj `NewMapXmlSeq()`).

On that json you can work as you are used to with the json syntax. For seeing how the convert json looks you can use the `--log-verbose` command line flag

## CSV Data comparison

If the response format is specified as `"type": "csv"`, we internally marshal that CSV into json.

On that json you can work as you are used to with the json syntax. For seeing how the convert json looks you can use the `--log-verbose` command line flag

You can also specify the delimiter (`comma`) for the CSV format (default: `,`):

```yaml
{
    "name": "CSV comparison",
    "request": {
        "endpoint": "export/1/files/file.csv",
        "method": "GET"
    },
    "response": {
        "format": {
            "type": "csv",
            "csv": {
                "comma": ";"
            }
        },
        "body": {
        }
    }
}
```

## Preprocessing responses

Responses in arbitrary formats can be preprocessed by calling any command line tool that can produce JSON, XML, CSV or binary output. In combination with the `type` parameter in `format`, non-JSON output can be [formatted after preprocessing](#reading-metadata-from-a-file-xml-format). If the result is already in JSON format, it can be [checked directly](#reading-metadata-from-a-file-json-format).

The response body is piped to the `stdin` of the tool and the result is read from `stdout`. The result of the command is then used as the actual response and is checked.

To define a preprocessing for a response, add a `format` object that defines the `pre_process` to the response definition:

```yaml
{
    "response": {
        "format": {
            "pre_process": {
                "cmd": {
                    "name": "...",
                    "args": [ ],
                    "output": "stdout"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

* `format.pre_process.cmd.name`: (string, mandatory) name of the command line tool
* `format.pre_process.cmd.args`: (string array, optional) list of command line parameters
* `format.pre_process.cmd.output`: (string, optional) what command output to use as result response, it can be one of `exitcode`, `stderr` or `stdout` (default)

### Examples

#### Basic usage: pipe response without changes

This basic example shows how to use the `pre_process` feature. The response is piped through `cat` which returns the input without any changes. This command takes no arguments.

```yaml
{
    "response": {
        "format": {
            "pre_process": {
                "cmd": {
                    "name": "cat"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Advanced usage: compare binary image with local one

This example shows how to use the `pre_process` feature with `stderr` output. The response is the metric result of running `imagemagick compare` which returns the absolute error between 2 images given a threshold (0 if identical, number of different pixels otherwise). The arguments are the piped binary from the response and the image to compare against (local file using `file_path` template function) .

```yaml
{
    "response": {
        "format": {
            "pre_process": {
                "cmd": {
                    "name": "compare",
                    "args": [
                        "-metric",
                        "AE",
                        "-fuzz",
                        "2%",
                        "-",
                        {{ file_path "other/file.jpg" | marshal }},
                        "/dev/null"
                    ],
                    "output": "stderr"
                }
            }
        },
        "body": 0
    }
}
```

* `format.pre_process`:
    * Command: `compare -metric AE -fuzz 2% - /path/to/other/file.jpg /dev/null`
    * Parameters:
        * `-metric AE`: metric to use for image comparison
        * `-fuzz 2%`: threshold for allowed pixel color difference
        * `-`: read first image from `stdin` instead loading a saved file
        * `/path/to/other/file.jpg `: read second image from local path (result from template function above)
        * `/dev/null`: discard stdout (it contains a binary we don't want, we use stderr output)

#### Reading metadata from a file (JSON Format)

To check the file metadata of a file that is directly downloaded as a binary file using the `eas/download` API, use `exiftool` to read the file and output the metadata in JSON format.

If there is a file with the asset ID `1`, and the apitest needs to check that the MIME type is `image/jpeg`, create the following test case:

```yaml
{
    "request": {
        "endpoint": "eas/download/1/original",
        "method": "GET"
    },
    "response": {
        "format": {
            "pre_process": {
                "cmd": {
                    "name": "exiftool",
                    "args": [
                        "-j",
                        "-g",
                        "-"
                    ]
                }
            }
        },
        "body": [
            {
                "File": {
                    "MIMEType": "image/jpeg"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

* `format.pre_process`:
    * Command: `exiftool -j -g -`
    * Parameters:
        * `-j`: output in JSON format
        * `-g`: group output by tag class
        * `-`: read from `stdin` instead loading a saved file

#### Reading metadata from a file (XML Format)

This example shows the combination of `pre_process` and `type`. Instead of calling `exiftool` with JSON output, it can also be used with XML output, which then will be formatted to JSON by the apitest tool.

```yaml
{
    "request": {
        "endpoint": "eas/download/1/original",
        "method": "GET"
    },
    "response": {
        "format": {
            "pre_process": {
                "cmd": {
                    "name": "exiftool",
                    "args": [
                        "-X",
                        "-"
                    ]
                }
            },
            "type": "xml"
        },
        "body": [
            {
                "File": {
                    "MIMEType": "image/jpeg"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

* `format.pre_process`:
    * Command: `exiftool -X -`
    * Parameters:
        * `-X`: output in XML format
        * `-`: read from `stdin` instead loading a saved file
* `format.type`:
    * `xml`: convert the output of `exiftool`, which is expected to be in XML format, into JSON

### Error handling

If there is any error during the call of the command line tool, the error is formatted as a JSON object and returned instead of the expected response:

```yaml
{
  "command": "cat --INVALID",
  "error": "exit status 1",
  "exit_code": 1,
  "stderr": "cat: unrecognized option '--INVALID'\nTry 'cat --help' for more information.\n"
}
```

* `command`: the command that was executed (consisting of `cmd.name` and `cmd.args`)
* `error`: error message (message of internal `exec.ExitError`)
* `exit_code`: integer value of the exit code
* `stderr`: additional error information from `stderr` of the command line tool

If such an error is expected as a result, this formatted error message can be checked as the response.

# Datastore

The datastore is a storage for arbitrary data. It can be set directly or set using values received from a response. It has two parts:

* Custom storage with custom key
* Sequential response store per test suite (one manifest)

The custom storage is persistent throughout the **apitest** run, so all requirements, all manifests, all tests. Sequential storage is cleared at the start of each manifest.

The custom store uses a **string** as index and can store any type of data.

**Array**: If an key ends in `[]`, the value is assumed to be an Array, and is appended. If no Array exists, an array is created.

**Map**: If an key ends in `[key]`, the value is assumed to be an map, and writes the data into the map at that key. If no map exists, an map is created.

```yaml
{
    "store": {
        "eas_ids[]": 15,
        "mapStorage[keyIWantToStore]": "value"
    }
}
```

This example would create an Array in index **eas_ids** and append **15** to it.

Arrays are useful using the Go-Template **range** function.

## Set Data in Custom Store

To set data in custom store, you can use 4 methods:

* Use `store`on the **manifest.json** top level, the data is set before the session authentication (if any)
* Use `store_response_qjson`in `authentication.store_response_qjson`
* Use `store`on the **test** level, the data is set before **request** and **response** are evaluated
* Use `store_response_qjson`on the test level, the data is set after each **response** (If you want the datestore to delete the current entry if no new one could be found with qjson. Just prepend the qjson key with a `!`. E.g. `"eventId":"!body.0._id"` will delete the `eventId` entry from the datastore if `body.0._id` could not be found in the response json)

All methods use a Map as value, the keys of the map are **string**, the values can be anything. If the key (or **index**) ends in `[]`and Array is created if the key does not yet exists, or the value is appended to the Array if it does exist.

The method `store_response_qjson` takes only **string** as value. This qjson-string is used to parse the current response using the **qjson** feature. The return value from the qjson call is then stored in the datastore.

## Get Data from Custom Store

The data from the custom store is retrieved using the `datastore <key>`Template function. `key`must be used in any store method before it is requested. If the key is unset, the datastore function returns an empty **string**. Use the special key `-` to return the entire datastore.

Slices allow the backwards index access. If you have a slice of length 3 and access it at index `-1` you get the last
element in the slice (original index `2`)

If you access an invalid index for datastore `map[index]` or `slice[]` you get an empty string. No error is thrown.

## Get Data from Sequential Store

To get the data from the sequential store an integer number has to be given to the datastore function as **string**. So `datastore "0"` would be a valid request. This would return the response from first test of the current manifest. `datastore "-1"` returns the last response from the current manifest. `datastore "-2"` returns second to last from the current manifest. If the index is wrong the function returns an error.

The sequential store stores the body and header of all responses. Use `qjson` to access values in the responses. See template functions [`datastore`](#datastore-key) and [`qjson`](#qjson-path-json).

When using relative indices (negative indices), use the same index to get values from the datastore to use in the request and response definition. Especially, for evaluating the current response, it has not yet been stored. So, `datastore "-1"` will still return the last response in the datastore. The current response will be appended after it was evaluated, and then will be returned with `datastore "-1"`.

# Use control structures

We support certain control structures in the **response definition**. You can use this control structures when ever you
are able to set keys in the json (so you have to be inside a object).
Some of them also need a value and some don't. For those which don't need a value you can just setup the control structure
without a second key with some weird value. When you give a value the tool always tries to deep check if that value is
correct and present in the actual reponse. So be aware of this behavior as it could interfere with your intended test
behavior.

## Define a control structure
In the example we use the jsonObject `test` and define some control structures on it. A control structure uses the key it
is attached to plus `:control`. So for our case it would be `test:control`. The tool gets that this two keys `test` and
`test:control` are in relationship with each other.

```yaml
{
    "test": {
        "hallo": 2,
        "hello": 3
    },
    "test:control": {
        "is_object": true,
        "no_extra": true
    }
}
```


## Available controls

Their are several controls available. The first two `no_extra` and `order_matters` always need their responding real key
and value to function as intended. The others can be used without a real key.

Default behavior for all keys is `=false`. So you only have to set them if you want to explicit use them as `true`

### `no_extra`

This commands defines an exact match, if it is set, their are no more fields allowed in the response as defined in the
testcase.

`no_extra` is available for objects and arrays

The following response would **fail**  as their are to many fields in the actual response

#### expected response defined with no_extra

```yaml
{
    "body": {
        "testObject": {
            "a": "z",
            "b": "y"
        },
        "testObject:control": {
            "no_extra": true
        }
    }
}
```

#### actual response

```yaml
{
    "body": {
        "testObject": {
            "a": "z",
            "b": "y",
            "c": "to much, so we fail"
        }
    }
}
```

### `order_matters`

This commands defines that the order in an array should be checked.

`order_matters` is available **only for arrays**

E.g. the following response would **fail**  as the order in the actual response is wrong

#### expected response defined with order_matters

```yaml
{
    "body": {
        "testArray": [
            "a",
            "b",
            "c"
        ],
        "testArray:control": {
            "order_matters": true
        }
    }
}
```

#### actual response

```yaml
{
    "body": {
        "testArray": [
            "c",
            "b",
            "a"
        ]
    }
}
```

### `must_exist`

Check if a certain value does exist in the reponse (no matter what its content is)

`must_exist` is available for all types.

This control can be used without a "real" key. So only the `:control` key is present.

E.g. the following response would **fail**  as `"iShouldExists"` is  **not** in the actual response

#### expected response defined with must_exist

```yaml
{
    "body": {
        "iShouldExists:control": {
            "must_exist": true
        }
    }
}
```

### `element_count`

Check if the size of an array equals the element_count

`element_count` is available only for arrays

This control can be used without a "real" key. So only the `:control` key is present.

E.g. the following response would **fail**  as `"count"` is has the wrong length

#### expected response defined with must_exist

```yaml
{
    "body": {
        "count:control": {
            "element_count": 2
        }
    }
}
```

#### actual response

```yaml
{
    "body": {
        "count": [
            1,
            2,
            3
        ]
    }
}
```

### `element_no_extra`

Passes the no extra to the underlying structure in an array

`must_exist` is available only for arrays

This control can be used without a "real" key. So only the `:control` key is present.

E.g. the following response would **fail**  as `"hasExtra"` is has extras

#### expected response defined with must_exist

```yaml
{
    "body": {
        "count": [
            {
                "fine": true,
            }
        ],
        "count:control": {
            "element_no_extra": true
        }
    }
}
```

#### actual response

```yaml
{
    "body": {
        "count": [
            {
                "fine": true,
                "extra": "shouldNotBeHere"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### `must_not_exist`

Check if a certain value does not exist in the reponse

`must_not_exist` is available for all types.

This control can be used without a "real" key. So only the `:control` key is present.

E.g. the following response would **fail**  as `"iShouldNotExists"` is in the actual response

#### expected response defined with must_exist

```yaml
{
    "body": {
        "iShouldNotExists:control": {
            "must_not_exist": true
        }
    }
}
```

##### actual response

```yaml
{
    "body": {
        "iShouldNotExists": "i exist, hahahah"
    }
}
```

### `match`

Check if a string value matches a given [regular expression](https://gobyexample.com/regular-expressions)

#### expected string response checked with regex

```yaml
{
    "body": {
        "text:control": {
            "match": ".+-\\d+"
        }
    }
}
```

#### actual response

```yaml
{
    "body": {
        "text": "valid_string-123"
    }
}
```

### `starts_with`

Check if a string value starts with a given string prefix

#### expected string response checked with prefx

```yaml
{
    "body": {
        "text:control": {
            "starts_with": "abc-"
        }
    }
}
```

#### actual response

```yaml
{
    "body": {
        "text": "abc-123"
    }
}
```

### `ends_with`

Check if a string value ends with a given string suffix

#### expected string response checked with suffix

```yaml
{
    "body": {
        "text:control": {
            "ends_with": "-123"
        }
    }
}
```

#### actual response

```yaml
{
    "body": {
        "text": "abc-123"
    }
}
```

### Type checkers

With `is_string`, `is_bool`, `is_object`, `is_array` and `is_number` you can check if your field has a certain type

The type checkers are available for all types. It implicit also checks `must_exist` for the value as there is no sense in
type checking a value that does not exist.

This control can be used without a "real" key. So only the `:control` key is present.

E.g. the following response would **fail**  as `"testNumber"` is no number in the actual response

#### expected response defined with `is_number`

```yaml
{
    "body": {
        "testNumber:control": {
            "is_number": true
        }
    }
}
```

#### actual response

```yaml
{
    "body": {
        "testNumber": false
    }
}
```

### Number range checkers

With `number_gt`(greater than `>`), `number_ge`(greater equal `>=`), `number_lt` (less than `<`), `number_le` (less equal `<=`) you can check if your field of type number (implicit check) is in certain number range

This control can be used without a "real" key. So only the `:control` key is present.

E.g. the following response would **fail**  as `"beGreater"` is smaller than expected

#### expected response defined with `number_gt`

```yaml
{
    "body": {
        "beGreater:control": {
            "number_gt": 5
        }
    }
}
```

#### actual response

```yaml
{
    "body": {
        "beGreater": 4
    }
}
```




# Use external file

In the request and response part of the single testcase you also can load the content from an external file
This is exspecially helpfull for keeping the manifest file simpler/smaller and keep a better overview. **On top: You can use so called template functions in the external file.** (We will dig deeper into the template functions later)

A single test could look as simple as following:

```yaml
{
    "name": "Test loading request & response from external file",
    "request": "@path/to/requestFile.json",
    "response": "@path/to/responseFile.json"
}
```

**Important: The paths to the external files start with a '@' and are relative to the location of the manifest.json or
can be web urls e.g. https://programmfabrik.de/testfile.json**

The content of the request and response file are execatly the same as if you would place the json code inline:

## Request:

```yaml
{
    "body": {
        "animal": "dog",
        "flower": "rose"
    },
    "body_type": "urlencoded",
    "endpoint": "suggest",
    "header": {
        "header1": "value",
        "header2": "value"
    },
    "method": "GET",
    "query_params": {
        "number": 2,
        "token": "testtoken"
    }
}
```

## Response:

```yaml
{
    "body": {
        "objecttypes": [
            "pictures"
        ],
        "query": ">>>[0-9]*<<<"
    },
    "header": {
        "key1": [
            "val1",
            "val2",
            "val3"
        ],
        "x-easydb-token": [
            "csdklmwerf8\u00dfwji02kopwfjko2"
        ]
    },
    "statuscode": 200
}
```

# Template functions

As described before, if you use an external file you can make use of so called template functions. What they are and how they work for the apitesting tool is described in the following part.

Template Functions are invoked using the tags `{{ }}` and upon returning substitutes the function call with
its result. We use the golang "text/template" package so all functions provided there are also supported here.
For a reference see [https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/]

```sequence
manifest.json->external file: load external file
external file->another file: render template with file parameter "hello"
another file->external file: return rendered template "hello world"
external file->manifest.json: return rendered template
```

### Example
Assume that the template function `myfunc`, given the arguments `1 "foo"`, returns
`"bar"`. The call `{{ myfunc 1 "foo" }}` would translate to `bar`.
Consequently, rendering `Lets meet at the {{ myfunc 1 "foo" }}` results in an invitation to the `bar`.

We provide the following functions:

## `file "relative/path/" [param1] ... [param4]`

Helper function to load contents of a file; if this file contains templates; it will render these templates with the up to 4 parameters provided in the call `@param1-4: string;` can be accessed from the loaded file via `{{ .Param1-4 }};` see example below

Loads the file with the relative path ( to the file this template function is invoked in ) "relative/path" or a weburl e.g. https://docs.google.com/test/tmpl.txt

The loaded file will be rendered with the (up to) 4 provided parameters, that can be accessed using .Param1-4.

### Example

Content of file at `some/path/example.tmpl`:
```yaml
{{ load_file "../target.tmpl" "hello" }}
```

Content of file at `some/target.tmpl`:
```yaml
{{ .Param1 }} world`
```

Rendering `example.tmpl` will result in `hello world`

## `file_path "relative/path/"`

Returns the relative path ( to the file this template function is invoked in ) "relative/path" or a weburl e.g. https://docs.google.com/test/tmpl.txt

### Example

Absolute path of file at `some/path/myfile.cpp`:
```yaml
{{ file_path "../myfile.tmpl" }}
```

## `rows_to_map "keyColumn" "valueColumn" [input]`

Generates a key-value map from your input rows.

Assume you have the following structure in your sheet:

| column_a | column_b | column_c |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| row1a    | row1b    | row1c    |
| row2a    | row2b    | row2c    |

If you parse this now to CSV and then load it via `file_csv` you get the following JSON structure:

```yaml
[
    {
        "column_a": "row1a",
        "column_b": "row1b",
        "column_c": "row1c"
    },
    {
        "column_a": "row2a",
        "column_b": "row2b",
        "column_c": 22
    }
]
```

For mapping now certain values to a map you can use ` rows_to_map "column_a" "column_c" `  and the output will be a map with the following content:

```yaml
{
    "row1a": "row1c",
    "row2a": 22
}
```

## `group_rows "groupColumn" [rows]`

Generates an Array of rows from input rows. The **groupColumn** needs to be set to a column which will be used for grouping the rows into the Array.

The column needs to:

* be an **int64** column
* use integers between 0 and 999

The Array will group all rows with identical values in the **groupColumn**.

### Example

The CSV can look at follows, use **file_csv** to read it and pipe into **group_rows**

| batch | reference | title |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| int64 | string |  string |
| 1    | ref1a    | title1a |
| 1    | ref1b | title1b |
| 4    | ref4 | title4  |
| 3    | ref3   | titlte2  |

Produces this output (presented as **json** for better readability:

```yaml
[
    [
        {
            "batch": 1,
            "reference": "ref1a",
            "title": "title1a"
        },
        {
            "batch": 1,
            "reference": "ref1b",
            "title": "title1b"
        }
    ],
    [
        {
            "batch": 3,
            "reference": "ref3",
            "title": "title3"
        }
    ],
    [
        {
            "batch": 4,
            "reference": "ref4",
            "title": "title4"
        }
    ]
]
```

## `group_map_rows "groupColumn" [rows]`

Generates an Map of rows from input rows. The **groupColumn** needs to be set to a column which will be used for grouping the rows into the Array.

The column needs to be a **string** column.

The Map will group all rows with identical values in the **groupColumn**.

### Example

The CSV can look at follows, use **file_csv** to read it and pipe into **group_rows**

| batch | reference | title |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| string | string |  string |
| one    | ref1a    | title1a |
| one    | ref1b | title1b |
| 4    | ref4 | title4  |
| 3    | ref3   | titlte2  |

Produces this output (presented as **json** for better readability:

```yaml
{
    "one": [
        {
            "batch": "one",
            "reference": "ref1a",
            "title": "title1a"
        },
        {
            "batch": "one",
            "reference": "ref1b",
            "title": "title1b"
        }
    ],
    "4": [
        {
            "batch": "4",
            "reference": "ref3",
            "title": "title3"
        }
    ],
    "3": [
        {
            "batch": "3",
            "reference": "ref4",
            "title": "title4"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Template Example

With the parameters `keyColumn` and `valueColumn` you can select the two columns you want to use for map. (Only two are supported)

The `keyColumn`  **must** be of the type string, as it functions as map index (which is of type string)


```django
{{ unmarshal "[{\"column_a\": \"row1a\",\"column_b\": \"row1b\",\"column_c\": \"row1c\"},{\"column_a\": \"row2a\",\"column_b\": \"row2b\",\"column_c\": \"row2c\"}]" | rows_to_map "column_a" "column_c"  | marshal  }}
```

Rendering that will give you :
```yaml
{
    "row1a": "row1c",
    "row2a": "row2c"
}
```

### Behavior in corner cases

#### No keyColumn given

The function returns an empty map

For `rows_to_map`:

```go
{}
```

#### No valueColumn given

The complete row gets mapped

For `rows_to_map "column_a"`:

```go
{
    "row1a":{
        column_a: "row1a",
        column_b: "row1b",
        column_c: "row1c",
    },
    "row2a":{
        column_a: "row2a",
        column_b: "row2b",
        column_c: "row2c",
    }
}
```

#### A row does not contain a key column

The row does get skipped

**Input:**

```go
[
    {
        column_a: "row1a",
        column_b: "row1b",
        column_c: "row1c",
    },
    {
        column_b: "row2b",
        column_c: "row2c",
    }
    {
        column_a: "row3a",
        column_b: "row3b",
        column_c: "row3c",
    }
]
```

For `rows_to_map "column_a" "column_c" `:

```go
{
    row1a: "row1c",
    row3a: "row3c",
}
```

#### A row does not contain a value column

The value will be set to `""` (empty string)

**Input:**

```go
[
    {
        column_a: "row1a",
        column_b: "row1b",
        column_c: "row1c",
    },
    {
        column_a: "row2a",
        column_b: "row2b",
    }
    {
        column_a: "row3a",
        column_b: "row3b",
        column_c: "row3c",
    }
]
```

For `rows_to_map "column_a" "column_c" `:

```go
{
    row1a": "row1c",
    row2a: "",
    row3a: "row3c",
}
```

## `datastore [key]`

Helper function to query the datastore; used most of the time in conjunction with `qjson`.

The `key`can be an int, or int64 accessing the store of previous responses. The responses are accessed in the order received. Using a negative value access the store from the back, so a value of **-2** would access the second to last response struct.

This function returns a string, if the `key`does not exists, an empty string is returned.

If the `key` is a string, the datastore is accessed directly, allowing access to custom set values using `store` or `store_response_qjson`parameters.

The datastore stores all responses in a list. We can retrieve the response (as a json string) by using this
template function. `{{ datastore 0  }}` will render to

```yaml
{
    "statuscode": 200,
    "header": {
        "foo": [
            "bar",
            "baz"
        ]
    },
    "body": "..."
}
```

This function is intended to be used with the `qjson` template function.

The key `-` has a special meaning, it returns the entire custom datastore (not the sequentially stored responses)

## `qjson [path] [json]`

Helper function to extract fields from the 'json'.
- `@path`: string; a description of the location of the field to extract. For array access use integers; for object access use keys. Example: 'body.1.field'; see below for more details
- `@json_string`: string; a valid json blob to be queried; can supplied via pipes from 'datastore idx'
- `@result`: the content of the json blob at the specified path

### Example
The call

```django
{{ qjson "foo.1.bar" "{\"foo": [{\"bar\": \"baz\"}, 42]}" }}
```

 would return `baz`.

As an example with pipes, the call

```django
{{ datastore idx | qjson "header.foo.1" }}
```

 would return`bar` given the response above.

See [gjson](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/README.md)



## `file_csv [path] [delimiter]`

Helper function to load a csv file.
- `@path`: string; a path to the csv file that should be loaded. The path is either relative to the manifest or a weburl
- `@delimiter`: rune; The delimiter that is used in the given csv e.g. ','
- `@result`: the content of the csv as json array so we can work on this data with qjson

The CSV **must** have a certain structur. If the structure of the given CSV differs, the apitest tool will fail with a error

- In the first row must be the names of the fields
- In the seconds row must be the types of the fields

**Valid types**
- int64
- int
- string
- float64
- bool
- int64,array
- string,array
- float64,array
- bool,array
- json

All types can be prefixed with * to return a pointer to the value. Empty strings initialize the Golang zero value for the type,  for type array the empty string inialized an empty array. The empty string returns an untyped **nil**.

### Example

Content of file at `some/path/example.csv`:
```csv
id,name
int64,string
1,simon
2,martin
```

The call

```django
{{ file_csv "some/path/example.csv" ','}}
```

would result in

```go
[map[id:1 name:simon] map[id:2 name:martin]]
```

As an example with pipes, the call

```django
{{ file_csv "some/path/example.csv" ',' | marshal | qjson "1.name" }}
```

 would result in `martin` given the response above.

### Cornercases

There are some corner cases that trigger a certain behavior you should keep in mind

#### No format for a column given

The column gets skipped in every row

**Input**

```csv
id,name
int64,
1,simon
2,martin
```

**Result**

```go
[map[id:1] map[id:2]]
```



#### No name for a column given

The column gets skipped in every row

**Input**

```csv
,name
int64,string
1,simon
2,martin
```

**Result**

```go
[map[name:simon] map[name:martin]]
```



#### Comment or empty line

If there is a comment marked with `#` , or a empty line that does not get rendered into the result

**Input**

```csv
id,name
int64,string
1,simon
2,martin
#3,philipp
4,roman
#5,markus


6,klaus
7,sebastian
```

**Result**

```go
[map[name:simon] map[name:martin] map[name:roman] map[name:klaus] map[name:sebastian]]
```

## `file_sqlite [path] [statement]`

Helper function to return the result of an SQL statement from a sqlite3 file.
- `@path`: string; a path to the sqlite file that should be loaded. The path is either relative to the manifest or a weburl
- `@statement`: string; a SQL statement that returns data (`SELECT`)
- `@result`: the result of the statement as a json array so we can work on this data with qjson

### Example

Content of sqlite file at `some/path/example.sqlite`:

Table `names`:
- column `id`: type `INTEGER`
- column `name`: type `TEXT`

| id | name |
|---|---|
| `2` | `martin` |
| `3` | NULL |
| `1` | `simon` |

The call

```django
{{ file_sqlite "some/path/example.sqlite" `
    SELECT id, name FROM names
    WHERE name IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY id ASC
` }}
```

would result in

```go
[map[id:1 name:simon] map[id:2 name:martin]]
```

### Working with `NULL` values

`NULL` values in the database are returned as `nil` in the template. To check if a value in the sqlite file is `NULL`, us a comparison to `nil`:

The call

```django
{{ file_sqlite "some/path/example.sqlite" `
    SELECT id, name FROM names
    ORDER BY id ASC
` }}
```

would result in

```go
[map[id:1 name:simon] map[id:2 name:martin] map[id:3 name:nil]]
```

The `NULL` value in `name` can be checked with

```django
{{ if ne $row.name nil }}
    // use name, else skip
{{ end }}
```

## `slice [parms...]`

## `subtract [a] [b]`

Returns `a - b`. `a, b` can be any numeric type or string. The function returns a numeric type, depending on the input. With `string` we return `int64`.

## `multiply [a] [b]`

## `query_escape [string]`

Returns a `string` as the result of escaping input as if it was intended for use in a URL query string.

## `query_unescape [string]`

Returns a `string` as the result of unescaping input as if it was coming from a URL query string.

## `base64_encode [string]`

Returns a `string` as the result of encoding input into base64.

## `base64_decode [string]`

Returns a `string` as the result of decoding input from base64.

## `url_path_escape [string]`

Uses [Url.PathEscape](https://pkg.go.dev/net/url?tab=doc#PathEscape) to escape given `string` to use in `endpoint` or `server_url`. Returns `string`.

## `match [regex] [text]`

Returns a `bool` value. If `text` matches the [regular expression](https://gobyexample.com/regular-expressions) `regex`, it returns `true`, else `false`. This is useful inside `{{ if ... }}` templates.

## `printf [interface{}...]`

Just for reference, this is a Go Template [built-in](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#hdr-Functions).

## `N [float64|int64|int]`

Returns a slice of n 0-sized elements, suitable for ranging over.

Example how to range over 100 objects

```django
{
    "body":  [
        {{ range $idx, $v := N 100 }}
        ...
        {{ end }}
    ]
}
```

## `replace_host [url]`

**replace_host** replaces the host and port in the given `url` with the actual address of the built-in HTTP server (see below). This address, taken from the `manifest.json` can be overwritten with the command line parameter `--replace-host`.

As an example, the URL _http://localhost/myimage.jpg_ would be changed into _http://localhost:8788/myimage.jpg_ following the example below.

## `server_url`

**server_url** returns the server url, which can be globally provided in the config file or directly by the command line parameter `--server`. This is a `*url.URL`.

## server_url_no_user

**server_url_no_user** returns the server url, which can be globally provided in the config file or directly by the command line parameter `--server`. Any information about the user authentification is removed. This is a `*url.URL`.

If the **server_url** is in the form of _http://user:password@localhost_, **server_url_no_user** will return _http://localhost_.

## `is_zero`

**is_zero** returns **true** if the passed value is the Golang zero value of the type.

## `oauth2_password_token [client] [username] [password]`

**oauth2_password_token** returns an **oauth token** for a configured client and given some user credentials. Such token is an object which contains several properties, being **access_token** one of them. It uses the `trusted` oAuth2 flow

Example:

```django
{
    "store": {
        "access_token": {{ oauth2_password_token "my_client" "john" "pass" | marshal | qjson "access_token" }}
    }
}
```

## `oauth2_client_token [client]`

**oauth2_client_token** returns an **oauth token** for a configured client. Such token is an object which contains several properties, being **access_token** one of them. It uses the `client credentials` oAuth2 flow.

Example:

```django
{
    "store": {
        "access_token": {{ oauth2_client_token "my_client" | marshal | qjson "access_token" }}
    }
}
```

## `oauth2_code_token [client] ...[[key] [value]]`

**oauth2_code_token** returns an **oauth token** for a configured client and accepts a variable number of key/value parameters. Such token is an object which contains several properties, being **access_token** one of them. It uses the `code grant` oAuth2 flow.

Behind the scenes the function will do a GET request to the `auth URL`, adding such parameters to it, and interpret the last URL such request was redirected to, extracting the code from it and passing it to the last step of the regular flow.

Example:

```django
{
    "store": {
        "access_token": {{ oauth2_code_token "my_client" "username" "myuser" "password" "mypass" | marshal | qjson "access_token" }}
    }
}
```

Or:

```django
{
    "store": {
        "access_token": {{ oauth2_code_token "my_client" "guess_access" "true" | marshal | qjson "access_token" }}
    }
}
```

## `oauth2_implicit_token [client] ...[[key] [value]]`

**oauth2_implicit_token** returns an **oauth token** for a configured client and accepts a variable number of key/value parameters. Such token is an object which contains several properties, being **access_token** one of them. It uses the `implicit grant` oAuth2 flow.

Behind the scenes the function will do a GET request to the `auth URL`, adding such parameters to it, and interpret the last URL such request was redirected to, extracting the token from its fragment.

Example:

```django
{
    "store": {
        "access_token": {{ oauth2_password_token "my_client" "myuser" "mypass" | marshal | qjson "access_token" }}
    }
}
```

## `oauth2_client [client]`

**oauth2_client** returns a configured **oauth client** given its `client_id`. Result is an object which contains several properties.

Example:

```django
{
    "store": {
        "oauth2_client_config": {{ oauth2_client "my_client" | marshal }}
    }
}
```

## `oauth2_basic_auth [client]`

** oauth2_basic_auth** returns the authentication header for basic authentication for the given oauth client.

# HTTP Server

The apitest tool includes an HTTP Server. It can be used to serve files from the local disk temporarily. The HTTP Server can run in test mode. In this mode, the apitest tool does not run any tests, but starts the HTTP Server in the foreground, until CTRL-C in pressed.
It is possible to define a proxy in the server which accepts and stores request data.
It is useful if there is need to test that expected webhook calls are properly performed.
Different stores can be configured within the proxy.

To configure a HTTP Server, the manifest need to include these lines:

```yaml
{
    "http_server": {
        "addr": ":8788", // address to listen on
        "dir": "", // directory to server, relative to the manifest.json, defaults to "."
        "testmode": false, // boolean flag to switch test mode on / off
        "proxy": { // proxy configuration
            "test": { // proxy store configuration
                "mode": "passthru" // proxy store mode
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The proxy `mode` parameter supports these values:
- `passthru` : The request is stored as it is, without further processing

The HTTP Server is started and stopped per test.

## HTTP Endpoints

The server provides endpoints to serve local files and return responses based on request data.

### Static files

To access any static file, use the path relative to the server directory (`dir`) as the endpoint:

```yaml
{
    "request": {
        "endpoint": "path/to/file.jpg",
        "method": "GET"
    }
}
```

If there is any error (for example wrong path), a HTTP error repsonse will be returned.

#### No Content-Length header

For some tests, you may not want the Content-Length header to be sent alongside the asset
In this case, add `no-content-length=1` to the query string of the asset url:
```yaml
{
    "request": {
        "endpoint": "path/to/file.jpg?no-content-length=1",
        "method": "GET"
    }
}
```

### `bounce`

The endpoint `bounce` returns the binary of the request body, as well as the request headers and query parameters as part of the response headers.

```yaml
{
    "request": {
        "endpoint": "bounce",
        "method": "POST",
        "query_params": {
            "param1": "abc"
        },
        "header": {
            "header1": 123
        },
        "body": {
            "file": "@path/to/file.jpg"
        },
        "body_type": "multipart"
    }
}
```

The file that is specified is relative to the apitest file, not relative to the http server directory. The response will include the binary of the file, which can be handled with [`pre_process` and `format`](#preprocessing-responses).

Request headers are included in the response header with the prefix `X-Req-Header-`, request query parameters are included in the response header with the prefix `X-Req-Query-`:

```yaml
{
    "response": {
        "header": {
            "X-Req-Query-Param1": [
                "abc"
            ],
            "X-Req-Header-Header1": [
                "123"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### `bounce-json`

The endpoint `bounce-json` returns the a response that includes `header`, `query_params` and `body` in the body.

```yaml
{
    "request": {
        "endpoint": "bounce-json",
        "method": "POST",
        "query_params": {
            "param1": "abc"
        },
        "header": {
            "header1": 123
        },
        "body": {
            "value1": "test",
            "value2": {
                "hello": "world"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

will return this response:

```yaml
{
    "response": {
        "body": {
            "query_params": {
                "param1": [
                    "abc"
                ]
            },
            "header": {
                "Header1": [
                    "123"
                ]
            },
            "body": {
                "value1": "test",
                "value2": {
                    "hello": "world"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### `bounce-query`

The endpoint `bounce-query` returns the a response that includes in its `body` the request `query string` as it is.
This is useful in endpoints where a body cannot be configured, like oAuth urls, so we can simulate responses in the request for testing.

```yaml
{
    "request": {
        "endpoint": "bounce-query?here=is&all=stuff",
        "method": "POST",
        "body": {}
    }
}
```

will return this response:

```yaml
{
    "response": {
        "body": "here=is&all=stuff"
    }
}
```

## HTTP Server Proxy

The proxy different stores can be used to both store and read their stored requests
The configuration, as already defined in [HTTP Server](#http-server), is as follows:

```
"proxy": { // proxy configuration
    "<store_name>": { // proxy store configuration
        "mode": "passthru" // proxy store mode
    }
}
```

| Key            | Value Type     | Value description                                                        |
|----------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| proxy          | JSON Object    | An object with the store names as keys and their configuration as values |
| <store_name>   | JSON Object    | An object with the store configuration                                   |
| mode           | string         | The mode the store runs on (see below)                                   |

Store modes:

| Value        | Description                                                                            |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| passthru     |  The request to the proxy store will be stored as it is without any further processing |


### Write to proxy store

Perform a request against the http server path `/proxywrite/<store_name>`.
Where `<store_name>` is a key (store name) inside the `proxy` object in the configuration.
The expected response will have either `200` status code and the used offset as body or another status and an error body.

Given this request:
```yaml
{
    "endpoint": "/proxywrite/test",
    "method": "POST",
    "query_params": {
        "some": "param"
    },
    "header": {
        "X-My-Header": 0
    },
    "body": {
        "post": {
            "my": ["body", "here"]
        }
    }
}
```

The expected response:
```yaml
{
    "statuscode": 200,
    "body": {
        "offset": 0
    }
}
```

### Read from proxy store

Whatever request performed against the server path `/proxyread/<store_name>?offset=<offset>`.
Where:
- `<store_name>` is a key inside the `proxy` object in the server configuration, aka the proxy store name
- `<offset>` represents the entry to be retrieved in the proxy store requests collection. If not provided, 0 is assumed.

Given this request:
```yaml
{
    "endpoint": "/proxyread/test",
    "method": "GET",
    "query_params": {
        "offset": 0
    }
}
```

The expected response:
```yaml
{
    "header": { // Merged headers. original request headers prefixed with 'X-Request`
        "X-Apitest-Proxy-Request-Method": ["POST"], // The method of the request to the proxy store
        "X-Apitest-Proxy-Request-Path": ["/proxywrite/test"], // The url path requested (including query string)
        "X-Apitest-Proxy-Request-Query": ["is=here&my=data&some=value"], // The request query string only
